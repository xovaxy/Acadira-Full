# Conversation Tracking - Already Working! ✅

## How It Works

Your system **already saves all conversations** automatically! Here's how:

### **Student Side (Automatic)**
When a student uses the AI Tutor:
1. ✅ **New chat created** - First message creates a session
2. ✅ **Every message saved** - User questions saved to database
3. ✅ **AI responses saved** - Assistant answers saved to database
4. ✅ **Chat history persists** - Students can reload previous conversations

### **Admin Side (View Conversations)**
Admins can see ALL student conversations:

#### **How to View:**
1. **Login as Admin**
2. Go to **Admin Dashboard**
3. Click the **"Conversations"** tab (4th tab)
4. You'll see a table with:
   - Student name
   - Chat title
   - Last updated time
   - "View Chat" button

5. Click **"View Chat"** to see the full conversation

## Database Tables

### **chat_sessions**
Stores each chat session:
- `id` - Unique session ID
- `student_id` - Which student
- `institution_id` - Which school
- `title` - Chat title (first message preview)
- `created_at` - When started
- `updated_at` - Last activity

### **chat_messages**
Stores every message:
- `id` - Unique message ID
- `session_id` - Which chat
- `role` - "user" or "assistant"
- `content` - The actual message
- `created_at` - Timestamp

## Admin Dashboard Tabs

Your admin dashboard has **4 tabs**:

1. **📚 Curriculum** - Uploaded files
2. **👥 Students** - Manage users
3. **💬 Conversations** ← **View chats here!**
4. **📊 Questions** - Recent student questions

## Common Questions

### **Q: Where are conversations stored?**
A: In your Supabase database, tables: `chat_sessions` and `chat_messages`

### **Q: Can students delete conversations?**
A: Yes, they can delete their own chat sessions

### **Q: Can admins see deleted conversations?**
A: No, once deleted they're gone (database DELETE)

### **Q: Are conversations saved in real-time?**
A: Yes! Each message is saved immediately after sending

### **Q: Can I export conversations?**
A: Not yet built-in, but you can query the database directly

## Troubleshooting

### **"No conversations yet" message in Admin**
**Cause:** No student has used the AI tutor yet  
**Solution:** Login as a student and send a test message

### **Can't see specific student's chat**
**Check:**
1. Are you logged in as admin?
2. Is the student from your institution?
3. Did the student actually send messages?

### **Chat messages empty**
**Check:**
1. Did messages actually save? (check database)
2. RLS policies enabled? (they should be)
3. Network errors during save?

---

## Database Query (Manual Check)

To manually check if conversations are being saved:

```sql
-- Check chat sessions
SELECT 
  cs.id,
  cs.title,
  cs.created_at,
  p.full_name,
  p.email
FROM chat_sessions cs
JOIN profiles p ON p.user_id = cs.student_id
ORDER BY cs.updated_at DESC;

-- Check messages in a session
SELECT 
  role,
  content,
  created_at
FROM chat_messages
WHERE session_id = 'YOUR_SESSION_ID'
ORDER BY created_at ASC;
```
